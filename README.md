### Bank account
Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits
of money. Ignore the possibility of concurrent transactions!

A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make
deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops
can charge against the account.

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed
account must fail.
